I love books and I love the Spotify API. 

The Spotify API uses a variety of categories to note where the song you are listening to falls in on a range of different values. This way, it can determine easier what songs you enjoy.

This site is a work in progress where I attempt to build a similar API for books (style, author, word count, genre, tropes, etc) which I can then use to build an appropriate recommendation system.

It's here: [bookmarks][portfolio-bookmarks]. I am working on creating a user system and building out a book database. I've written it in Django, styling using CSS, JavaScript and HTML. It is hosted on AWS. The [source code][source-code] is available on GitHub.
